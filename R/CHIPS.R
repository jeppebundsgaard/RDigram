#' CHIPS (Children’s Problem Solving; Hansen, Kreiner, & Hansen, 1992) is an instrument for measuring cognitive function meant for children from 6 to 12 years of age. The theory of cognitive development behind CHIPS describes cognitive function in terms of the person’s ability to draw on qualitatively different types of strategies for solving abstract problems.
#' According to the theory, the cognitive function of children develops over three stages, called global (G), analytical/  synthetic (A/S), and comprehensive (C). At the global stage, the child registers likenesses more than anything else. At the analytic/synthetic stage, the child is able to cope with both likenesses and differences and to synthesize them to wholes. At these two stages in the cognitive development, the child is not yet ready to deal with abstract mental images but has to see or handle the physical objects. At the comprehensive stage, the child is able to use abstract principles and rules when it is required for problem solving.
#' CHIPS provides some possibility for evaluating the level of cognitive function in quantitative terms. The main purpose of CHIPS, however, is to classify pupils according to the three stages of cognitive development.

#' CHIPS consists of three sets of items:
#' \item {11 G items requiring global cognition,}
#' \item {14 A/S items requiring analytic/synthetic cognition, and}
#' \item {15 C items requiring comprehensive cognition. }
