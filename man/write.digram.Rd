\description{
Writes a RDigram object to DIGRAM files.
}
\details{
DIGRAM is a Windows based program. Therefore it expects CRLF (\r\n) newlines. If you edit the files in Linux after export, your might need to take care to keep the CRLF newlines.
DIGRAM doesn't accept labels with more than one character. Therefore two-character labels are converted starting from AA->a. Labels from BA are special characters, starting from BA->Ã¼. DIGRAM might not like RDigram's choice of characters.
DIGRAM doesn't accept more than 58 categories. Therefore variables with more than 58 categories are re-coded to include only 58 categories.
